# Force Windows 10 Pro Installation on OEM Laptops (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc.)

Some laptops come with an **OEM license key for Windows 10 Home** embedded in their BIOS/UEFI.  
When you try to reinstall Windows, the setup will automatically pick *Home* and won‚Äôt let you choose other editions such as *Pro*.

This guide shows you how to bypass that auto-selection and install **Windows 10 Pro** instead, without needing a valid Pro license upfront.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You‚Äôll still need a genuine Pro key later if you want to activate Windows.

## üì¶ Requirements
- A Windows 10 ISO (you can get a legit one from Microsoft directly).
- A USB installer (created with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or Microsoft‚Äôs Media Creation Tool).
- Basic file editing skills (Notepad will do).

## üõ†Ô∏è Method 1 ‚Äî Add `ei.cfg`
